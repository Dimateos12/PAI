# Advanced Object-Oriented Programming and React Web Application Project with Generic Repository Pattern

## Project Description

This project focuses on creating an advanced web application that combines advanced object-oriented programming principles with the use of the Generic Repository Pattern in the backend and the React library in the frontend.

## Technologies

- **Backend:**
  - Programming Language: C# (latest standards preferred)
  - Framework: ASP.NET Core
  - Architecture: Advanced Object-Oriented Programming, Generic Repository Pattern
  - Database: (Specify your chosen database, e.g., Entity Framework)

- **Frontend:**
  - Library: React.js
  - State Management: Redux (optional)
  - Styling: (e.g., Styled Components, CSS Modules)

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:**
  - Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations using the Generic Repository Pattern.

- **User Interface:**
  - Utilize React to create a responsive and aesthetically pleasing user interface.

- **Authentication and Authorization:**
  - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms, e.g., using JWT.

- **API Communication:**
  - Use RESTful API for communication between the frontend and backend.

## Project Structure

- **Backend:**
  - `Controllers/`: API controllers
  - `Models/`: Data models
  - `Repositories/`: Generic Repository Pattern implementation
  - `Services/`: Business logic
  - `Startup.cs`: Application configuration

- **Frontend:**
  - `src/`: React source code
  - `public/`: Static resources
  - `redux/`: Redux configuration and reducers (optional)

## Requirements

- Node.js
- .NET SDK
- (Add other required dependencies)
